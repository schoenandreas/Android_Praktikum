5.3.2:

The design of Tab2Fragment is very basic. The first layout file tab2_fragment contains a ConstraintLayout that with a FloatingActionButton for the Speech Recognition, also TextView, ImageView and a SwitchCommand for moving between operating modes. The second layout tab2_fragment_transition is very similar to the first one with the difference that the FloatingActionButton is slightly repositioned in order to make space for the ImageView. This second layout will appear when the FloatingButton is clicked.
